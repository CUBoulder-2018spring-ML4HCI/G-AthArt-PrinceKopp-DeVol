Derek and Eli's DTW Project

### Goals
* The goal of this project was to train a dynamic time warping algorithm 

### Tools/Libraries
* 

### Feature Extraction
* 

### ML Algorithms Used/Tested

* Direction
  -Neural Network: We decided to use the Neural Network algorithm as it produced the desired results for controlling direction

* Stop/Go (Classifier)
  - KNN(1): Had 87.23% accuracy
  - KNN(3): Had 85.61% accuracy
  - Boosted Tree: **Had 92.24% accuracy**
  - Decision Tree: Had 86.48% accuracy
  We went with the Boosted Tree algorithm as it produced the most accurate results for classifying the hand positions
